# S-COM Software
[S]-ite [COM]-MUNICATIONS

TCP server/client implementation for unix systems.

Todo:
-Encryption probably using https://github.com/kokke/tiny-AES-c (Amazing work by many talented people)
-Server commands, client commands (possibly a ftp type shell with a telnet like escape key)
-General cleanup of the code and finishing the client making it gracefully shutdown
-Ensure "somewhat" of a POSIX compatibility
-Command line arguments for the server and client (room passwords)
-OP powers for administrators
-Rate limiting and banning for IPs
